## 📁 Project Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
A simple chatbot that uses conditional logic (if-else rules and keyword matching) to respond to user inputs. It is a basic demonstration of non-ML conversational agents.

> 💡 Technologies: Python

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
A command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against an AI opponent. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to ensure optimal moves, making it unbeatable when played perfectly.

> 💡 Technologies: Python, Minimax Algorithm

---

### 🔹 Task 4: Recommendation System
A recommendation system that provides item suggestions to users based on user preferences or item similarity. Implemented using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques.

> 💡 Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn (or Surprise library)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
